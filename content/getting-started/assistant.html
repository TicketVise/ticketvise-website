            Hey there! Welcome to TicketVise. Let us introduce the role assistant to you. For the functionality that overlaps with
            that of a student, please read <a class="underline" href="student.html">Getting started as a Student</a>. Here we will elaborate some
            extra functionality that you as an assistant have access to.

    <h2 id="getting-permission" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Getting permissions</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
        To gain the extra permissions to answer questions, you don't have to do anything extra. Just visit TicketVise via a
        link on the canvas course and after the first time visiting, you account should be linked with the inbox, giving
        you the right permissions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="assigning-tickets" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Assigning tickets</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
        The assignment of tickets can happen in multiple ways, depending on the settings of the inbox. When you are
        automatically assigned to a ticket, you will recieve a notification, and you can find this ticket easily by
        filtering with the "My Tickets" button. If no staff member is assigned to a ticket, you can manually assign yourself
        or others by navigating to the ticket and changing the assignee. If you reply to a ticket, you will also be
        automatically assigned to this ticket.
    </p>

    <h2 id="answering-questions" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Answering questions</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Answering questions is probably what you are using TicketVise for. The tickets with the questions are found on the
        ticket page. In the input field below the question, you can formulate your answer to the question. This field
        supports markdown to better format the answer. Using markdown gives a better structured answer to help the reader of
        the answer understand it better. Looking above the question, three tabs can be seen. The question tab is to
        communicate with the student(s). The contents in this tab can be seen by both the staff members and the students.
        When you do not know how to answer a question directly, you can discuss this in the second "Discussion" tab. The
        messages in the discussion tab are only visible for the members of the teaching team, so you can discuss with your
        colleagues about the answer to the question, see the discussing questions section for more
        information. The third tab is for the attachments the student has added to the ticket.
    </p>

    <h2 id="discussing-questions" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Discussing questions</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800">
        In this internal tab, you can ask question to colleagues by mentioning them with the "<strong>@</strong>" character. They will
        receive a notification about this mention to quickly respond. Next to mentioning, you can also reference other
        tickets using the "<strong>#</strong>". This gives the other members of the teaching team a quick link to the similar question.
