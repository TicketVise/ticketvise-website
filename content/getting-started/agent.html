    Hey there! Welcome to TicketVise. Let us introduce the role agent to you. For the functionality that overlaps with
    that of a student, please read <a href="student.html">Getting started as a Student</a>. Here we will elaborate some
    extra functionality that you as an agent have access to.

    <div>
        jump to:<br>
        <a href="#getting-permission">Getting permissions</a><br>
        <a href="#assigning-tickets">Assigning tickets</a><br>
        <a href="#answering-questions">Answering questions</a><br>
        <a href="#discussing-questions">Discussing questions</a><br>
    </div>

    <h2 id="getting-permission" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Getting permissions</h2>
    To gain the extra permissions to answer questions, you don't have to do anything extra. Just visit TicketVise via a
    link on the canvas course and after the first time visiting, you account should be linked with the inbox, giving
    you the right permissions.

    <h2 id="assigning-tickets" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Assigning tickets</h2>
    The assignment of tickets can happen in multiple ways, depending on the settings of the inbox. When you are
    automatically assigned to a ticket, you will recieve a notification, and you can find this ticket easily by
    filtering with the "My Tickets" button. If no staff member is assigned to a ticket, you can manually assign yourself
    or others by navigating to the ticket and changing the assignee. If you reply to a ticket, you will also be
    automatically assigned to this ticket.

    <h2 id="answering-questions" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Answering questions</h2>
    Answering questions is probably what you are using TicketVise for. The tickets with the questions are found on the
    ticket page. In the input field below the question, you can formulate your answer to the question. This field
    supports markdown to better format the answer. Using markdown gives a better structured answer to help the reader of
    the answer understand it better. Looking above the question, three tabs can be seen. The external tab is to
    communicate with the student(s). The contents in this tab can be seen by both the staff members and the students.
    When you do not know how to answer a question directly, you can discuss this in the second "Internal" tab. The
    messages in the internal tab are only visible for the members of the teaching team, so you can discuss with your
    colleagues about the answer to the question, see <a href="#discussing-questions">Discussing questions</a> for more
    information. The third tab is for the attachments the student has added to the ticket.

    <h2 id="discussing-questions" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Discussing questions</h2>
    In this internal tab, you can ask question to colleagues by mentioning them with the "@" character. They will
    receive a notification about this mention to quickly respond. Next to mentioning, you can also reference other
    tickets using the "#". This gives the other members of the teaching team a quick link to the similar question.
