      Congratulations you have now installed TicketVise in Canvas!

  <h2 id="creating-inbox" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Creating an inbox</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Creating an inbox to match your course is as simple as creating a link on the canvas page. When you visit this link
    on the canvas page, you create the course in TicketVise. When students and agents click this link, they too will be
    added to the course, with the permissions inherited from canvas.
  </p>

  <h2 id="configuring-inbox" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring an inbox</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    When opening the inbox, you can go to the configuration to change some settings about the course. Most of these
    settings are self-explaining, we will quickly go over some of the others. Toggling the <em>"Assignee visible to
    students"</em> changes if the students can see if and who is assigned to their ticket. Replying on a ticket will however
    always show the author of the reply. You can set a timer for closing a ticket if no reply has been sent for some
    amount of time, or you can send an alert if no answer has been given after some time. These help to prevent tickets
    from being unanswered and keep them organised.
  </p>

  <h2 id="scheduling" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Scheduling</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    To automatically assign tickets
    to agents, there are two scheduling methods. Currently, there is an option to manually assign tickets, no automatic
    scheduling takes place. The least assigned first makes sure that every agent is assigned the same amount of tickets,
    if agent 1 that get a ticket from agent 2 assigned to them will not get another one assigned to them before agent 2
    has received a new ticket to compensate for the loss of the first. When using round robin, this will not happen, but
    all tickets will be assigned to the next TA in the list.
  </p>

  <h2 id="configuring-users" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring users</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    The users tab on the configuration page shows all users connected to the course known by TicketVise. As a coordinator,
    you can change the permissions of each user in the course and view information about them.
  </p>

  <h2 id="configuring-labels" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring labels</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Labels can be added to the wish of the coordinator. Labels are useful for organizing the tickets inside the course.
    Changing the visibility of the student or enabling the label in general are ways in which you can control the use of
    the labels. Labels not visible for students can be used to organise labels within the staff.
  </p>

  <h2 id="inbox-statistics" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">Inbox statistics</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    The statistics from the inbox gives insight in the amount of tickets and the activity of the agents. These insights
    can help to recognise where the problems lies with the students as well as the agents.
