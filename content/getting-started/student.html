  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Getting started as a student</h2>
  We are glad to introduce you to TicketVise! Here we walk you through the steps to get started with this application
  as a student. As a student you can ask questions to help you with your problems.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="creating-account">Create an account</h2>
  TicketVise is connected with canvas in such a way, that an account is created automatically when you open our
    application via canvas. After this first time, you are logged in automatically via canvas when opening the
    application, so you will always have your questions at hand without ever needing to login separately. This allows
    for a quick and user friendly access.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="joining-course">Joining a course</h2>
  Just like creating an account for the first time, joining a course is done by visiting the application via the
  course in canvas. Navigate to the course you want to ask a question about and that's it! The system now knows you
  are enrolled in this course and you are free to ask questions and get help from the staff. Each TicketVise inbox
  corresponds to a course to organise everything neatly.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="creating-ticket">Creating a ticket</h2>
  When navigating to the "Inboxes" on top of the page, you can select the inbox you want to create a ticket in. The
  overview you can see displays all of your previously asked questions, or questions that are shared with you.
  Creating a ticket is as simple as clicking the "New Ticket" button on the top of the page and formulating your
  question. The question field supports markdown, which can be easily used by the buttons in the editor. The markdown
    editor is by default set to a "WYSIWYG" editor. Adding labels to your ticket allows the staff better assign your
    question and increasing the chance and speed of a swift answer.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="replying-ticket">Replying on a ticket</h2>
  Whenever you got a reply that did not completely answer your question, you can post a reply yourself to ask a follow
  up question or for more clarification. These replies can be found on the page of your ticket underneath the reply of
  the staff. The reply field works the same as the question field when creating a ticket. Using markdown to improve
  the layout of your question helps the staff understand your question better and thus increases the quality of the
  answer you get.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="sharing-ticket">Sharing a ticket</h2>
  Found yourself in a situation where you and your buddies have the same question? Not a problem! As long as no
  personal information is asked in the question, you can share the ticket with other students by filling in their
  username (UvAnetID) and adding them to the ticket. This can be done by creating the ticket, but also after the
  ticket has been posted on the ticket page. Shared users can also see what you see and reply to the questions or
  answers.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="closing-ticket">Closing a ticket</h2>
  Receiving a reply that answers your question is always great! You can now work further on your assignment or
  continue learning. To let others know your question has been answered, you can close the ticket and clear some space
  for new ones, not just for your overview, but also for the overview of the hero that answered your question.

  <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800" id="reopening-ticket">Reopening a ticket</h2>
  Shoot! Satisfied with your answer in the first place, but after 5 more minutes of work a followup question arose? To
  keep the context of your previously asked question, you can reopen the ticket with a new reply. It's as easy as it
  sounds!
