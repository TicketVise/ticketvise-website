      We are glad to introduce you to TicketVise! Here we walk you through the steps to get started with this application
      as a student. As a student you can ask questions to help you with your problems.

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="creating-account">Create an account</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    TicketVise is connected with canvas in such a way, that an account is created automatically when you open our
    application via canvas. After this first time, you are logged in automatically via canvas when opening the
    application, so you will always have your questions at hand without ever needing to login separately. This allows
    for a quick and user friendly access.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="joining-course">Joining a course</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Just like creating an account for the first time, joining a course is done by visiting the application via the
    course in canvas. Navigate to the course you want to ask a question about and that's it! The system now knows you
    are enrolled in this course and you are free to ask questions and get help from the staff. Each TicketVise inbox
    corresponds to a course to organise everything neatly.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="creating-ticket">Creating a ticket</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    When navigating to the "Inboxes" on top of the page, you can select the inbox you want to create a ticket in. The
    overview you can see displays all of your previously asked questions, or questions that are shared with you.
    Creating a ticket is as simple as clicking the "New Ticket" button on the top of the page and formulating your
    question. The question field supports markdown, which can be easily used by the buttons in the editor. The markdown
    editor is by default set to a "WYSIWYG" editor. Adding labels to your ticket allows the staff better assign your
    question and increasing the chance and speed of a swift answer.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="replying-ticket">Replying on a ticket</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Whenever you got a reply that did not completely answer your question, you can post a reply yourself to ask a follow
    up question or for more clarification. These replies can be found on the page of your ticket underneath the reply of
    the staff. The reply field works the same as the question field when creating a ticket. Using markdown to improve
    the layout of your question helps the staff understand your question better and thus increases the quality of the
    answer you get.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="sharing-ticket">Sharing a ticket</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Found yourself in a situation where you and your buddies have the same question? Not a problem! As long as no
    personal information is asked in the question, you can share the ticket with other students by filling in their
    username (UvAnetID) and adding them to the ticket. This can be done by creating the ticket, but also after the
    ticket has been posted on the ticket page. Shared users can also see what you see and reply to the questions or
    answers.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="closing-ticket">Closing a ticket</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Receiving a reply that answers your question is always great! You can now work further on your assignment or
    continue learning. To let others know your question has been answered, you can close the ticket and clear some space
    for new ones, not just for your overview, but also for the overview of the hero that answered your question.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900" id="reopening-ticket">Reopening a ticket</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-800">
    Shoot! Satisfied with your answer in the first place, but after 5 more minutes of work a followup question arose? To
    keep the context of your previously asked question, you can reopen the ticket with a new reply. It's as easy as it
    sounds!
