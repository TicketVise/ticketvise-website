  Integrating TicketVise into your course is easy. There are two ways ways students can access TicketVise. Using a
  menu
  item in the course navigation of with a module.

  <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-lg font-bold text-gray-800">Course Navigation</h3>
  To install Ticketvise into your course navigation head over to the course <span class="font-semibold">Settings</span>
  and navigate to the <span class="font-semibold">Navigation</span> tab. At
  the bottom of the list you should be able to find TicketVise. By dragging TicketVise into the course navigation, you
  have made TicketVise accesible to your students and teaching assistants.

  <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-lg font-bold text-gray-800">Module</h3>
  Modules can give more strucutre to your course. To add TicketVise as a module head of to your course <span
    class="font-semibold">Modules</span>. Inside a module create a new item by pressing the add button. Select <span
    class="font-semibold">External tool</span> in the dropdown list. A new list will apear, search for TicketVise
  and press <span class="font-semibold">Add item</span>.


  <p> Congratulations you have now installed TicketVise in Canvas! One last step is needed to complete the
    installation. As a
    coordinator you have to be the first person the open TicketVise to create your course in the tool.</p>

  <h2 id="creating-inbox" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Creating an inbox</h2>
  Creating an inbox to match your course is as simple as creating a link on the canvas page. When you visit this link
  on the canvas page, you create the course in TicketVise. When students and agents click this link, they too will be
  added to the course, with the permissions inherited from canvas.

  <h2 id="configuring-inbox" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring an inbox</h2>
  When opening the inbox, you can go to the configuration to change some settings about the course. Most of these
  settings are self-explaining, we will quickly go over some of the others. Toggling the "Assignee visible to
  students" changes if the students can see if and who is assigned to their ticket. Replying on a ticket will however
  always show the author of the reply. You can set a timer for closing a ticket if no reply has been sent for some
  amount of time, or you can send an alert if no answer has been given after some time. These help to prevent tickets
  from being unanswered and keep them organised.

  <h2 id="scheduling" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Scheduling</h2>To automatically assign tickets
  to agents, there are two scheduling methods. Currently, there is an option to manually assign tickets, no automatic
  scheduling takes place. The least assigned first makes sure that every agent is assigned the same amount of tickets,
  if agent 1 that get a ticket from agent 2 assigned to them will not get another one assigned to them before agent 2
  has received a new ticket to compensate for the loss of the first. When using round robin, this will not happen, but
  all tickets will be assigned to the next ta in the list.

  <h2 id="configuring-users" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring users</h2>
  The users tab on the configuration page shows all users connected to the course known by TicketVise. As a manager,
  you can change the permissions of each user in the course and view information about them.

  <h2 id="configuring-labels" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Configuring labels</h2>
  Labels can be added to the wish of the manager. Labels are useful for organizing the tickets inside the course.
  Changing the visibility of the student or enabling the label in general are ways in which you can control the use of
  the labels. Labels not visible for students can be used to organise labels within the staff.

  <h2 id="inbox-statistics" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Inbox statistics</h2>
  The statistics from the inbox gives insight in the amount of tickets and the activity of the agents. These insights
  can help to recognise where the problems lies with the students as well as the agents.
