                Asking questions is a big part in being a student. We want to maximize the ability for students to learn
                by <span class="font-bold text-gray-800">improving the experience</span> of asking questions. By making
                a platform that is <span class="font-bold text-gray-800">personal</span> and <span
                    class="font-bold text-gray-800">flexible</span>, we encourage students to ask questions and follow
                these up if they want to know more.

                Creating a ticket is starting a conversations instead of asking a question. Responding to answers from
                the teaching team leads to a discussion with the assignee for a more personal conversation. Seeing who
                participated on the question shows the connection between you and the teaching team.

                Add labels to your ticket to organize your questions. Labels can be matched with assistants by the
                coordinator, this makes sure that fellow students with the same questions get consistent answers. Other
                students can also be given access to the ticket by sharing. Not needing to forward an answer and
                enabling shared students to ask for more elaboration directly saves time and effort, but increases
                clarity.

                Organizing the process for the teaching team guarantees an answer on the question. The response time is
                minimized due to the streamlined process. Giving students a quicker answer gives them more time to work
                on the assignments.
